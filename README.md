# Leaderboard Antisnipe

Will lock the global top 5 leaderboard when you load a map or when you enable the plugin for that map.

Only **your own** times will be updated. Disabling LB antisnipe will show you the current up-to-date records. Enabling it after that will lock the updated times in place.

Only works for global leaderboard.
